- 👋 Hi, I’m @sharccc
- 👀 I’m one of the HashiCorp Global Terraform Support team - supporting customers running Terraform Enterprise - on all the platforms
- 🌱 I'm continously learning everything about the product - all installation and runtime options - on aws, azure, gcp & vmware and replicated, docker, k8s and soon, podman
- 💞️ I'm passionate about deep-diving into issues, especially with Terraform HCL configuration, helping people out of bugs with the providers
